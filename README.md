# Castler-Front-End-Developer-Assignment
Created with CodeSandbox
Approach Used :
Created  two components
1: Info component - used for displaying the data whic is being feteched from the api
2: Number Component - used for setting the state and making call to the api which would bring the data 
Styles file used for styling of all the components
Handled edge case 
1: if a number is out of range of the given numbers then api would not be hit in that case and alert() would be there saying enter a valid number
2: Handled edge case of also that a user can only enter number in the text field
3: if a number is less than 1 or greater than 12 then also it would display an error also
